# AI-4-Informal-Settlement
The UNDP requires high resolution maps and granular statistics - on informal settlement or slums to develop programming opportunities in livelihoods, health, service, infrastructure, urban planning, disaster preparedness, and climate change adaption/mitigation. This information is important for the UNDP to successfully conductprograms to support the poor segment of population. However, most cities in Low and Middle Income Countries do not have reliable and timely high-resolution maps and granular statistics to plan intervention and monitor progress of poverty alleviation programs. 

This project is a proof of concept to comprehensively map informal urban settlements using Artificial Intelligence-based toolchain applied to Earth Observation Data.The project relies on low cost solutions focusing on Freely available Sentinel-2 and open-source tool  to map informal settlements and slums.
